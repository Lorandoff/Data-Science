The second project is on machine learning. Here, in addition to the methods of the previous project, there are: XGBoost, CatBoost (and the selection of hyperparameters through its own system), the support vector method, the first neural networks for regression and classification, KNN, cross-validation, the selection of hyperparameters through Optuna and new metrics of model quality (new to me then).
Files with normal names can be run in colab and enjoy all the graphs. I urge you to run the Customer Churn file in colab: https://colab.research.google.com . Otherwise, you will not see all the charts, because they are loaded online.
