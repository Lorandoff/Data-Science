This is my first interesting project in DS, although it would probably be more correct to say in Data Analysis. There are graphs, tables and statistics here)

The project is educational, so at the beginning of the notebook, the tasks look and sound like TK. In Plotly, all charts are interactive, so to see the whole project completely, start the laptop at home.
Files with normal names can be run in colab and enjoy all the graphs. I urge you to run the Game Market Analysisfile in colab: https://colab.research.google.com . Otherwise, you will not see all the charts, because they are loaded online.
